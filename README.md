# MIT_6.006
I'm going through MIT's 6.006 Intro to Algos course in order to dig deeper than the leetcode tutorials and really understand why I code what I code, in hopes that it 
will impact my code beyond the tech interviews. 

I'll put in here notes, practice code, code that I think of while taking the course, etc. Keeping this public for anyone who wants to compare their notes. 

Cheers!
